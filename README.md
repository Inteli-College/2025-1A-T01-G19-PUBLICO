## 1. Introduction

Game-Based Learning, as an active learning methodology, is believed to hold significant potential for programming education in basic education institutions in Brazil. To test this hypothesis, the authors intend to conduct a study with high school students who have no prior knowledge of programming yet demonstrate an interest in entering the field. It is anticipated that adopting this methodology could reinforce the acquisition of computational thinking, a skill considered fundamental in today’s context. Investigating the influence of game-based solutions in programming education underscores the importance of adopting innovative strategies within educational institutions. This approach suggests that gamified methods can render the learning process more dynamic and engaging, thereby reducing dropout rates and stimulating student interest from the basic education cycle onward. Furthermore, research into Game-Based Learning aims to expand access to programming education nationwide — challenging the paradigm that the discipline is exclusive to students with superior cognitive abilities or greater resources — and to promote the retention of students enrolled in higher education computing courses, ultimately encouraging the formation of professionals well-equipped for the labor market and fostering the development of innovative methods for conveying complex content.

**General Objective:**

The general objective of this work is to study the influence of pedagogical approaches based on the Game-Based Learning methodology on the learning of introductory programming.

**Specific Objectives:**

- Identify the existing game-based approaches for teaching programming.

- Identify trends regarding the adoption of game-based methodologies in programming education.

- Evaluate the learning process of students at the initial stages of programming using strategies from the Game-Based Learning methodology.

- Collect information from students in the early stages of programming regarding the use of game-based approaches.

- Assess the benefits and challenges involved in applying game-based methodologies to the teaching of programming.

## 2. Alignment with Proposed Schedule

- **Was the research process aligned with the initial schedule?**  
  [ ] Yes  
  [X] Partially  
  [ ] No

Our research includes an experimental phase conducted with students from a high school institution in São Paulo, where the study is being carried out. According to the initially established roadmap, the first module of this project would involve selecting the educational institution where the study would take place, as well as recruiting volunteer students willing to participate. However, the authors are currently still in the process of negotiating with the institution that best meets the established requirements. Thus, it is understood that the authors have partially met the proposed timeline for the first ten weeks of project development, given that other planned stages — such as the literature review, the writing of the introduction, and the preparation of an initial lesson plan for the proposed experimental phase — have been completed.

## 3. Evolution of the Research

During the first ten weeks of project development, corresponding to the first academic module of the year, the authors made significant progress in the ongoing research. Initially, alignment meetings were held with the faculty advisor overseeing the project, leading to the formulation of a Project Plan that outlined the initial proposal as well as the roadmap for the research development journey. Subsequently, a literature review phase was conducted, during which the authors sought relevant articles and examined the existing body of knowledge related to the topic.

Additionally, the research target audience was defined, establishing the specific elements encompassed by the project. An educational institution was selected, and negotiations were initiated to implement the methodology in partnership with the chosen school.

Regarding the writing of the article, the introduction was developed, including the literature review and outlining the researchers’ objectives with the study. The planned process for the remainder of the year was described, and portions of the methodology section have already been incorporated into the article.

In preparation for the lesson plan to be implemented with the volunteer students, a form was created to recruit participants for the pedagogical experiment. Furthermore, an initial diagnostic questionnaire was developed to assess students’ prior knowledge of computational thinking, as well as a final evaluation form to be administered after the sequence of lessons conducted by the researchers.

Weekly meetings have been held to present the research progress and to define the next steps of the project.

## 4. Obstacles and Challenges

A significant obstacle currently faced by the authors concerns obtaining authorization for the proposed experimentation, as it must be carried out with the support of an educational institution that can enable the implementation of the educational workshops. At present, the researchers are in the negotiation phase with the school they consider most appropriate for conducting the study. However, there is a possibility that the negotiation may not be successful, which would require seeking another institution for the application of the Game-Based Learning methodology. It is believed that, at this stage, this limitation represents the only major concern regarding the progress of the research, as adjustments to the initially proposed timeline may become necessary.

## 5. Future Developments

At the beginning of the second module of the project, the goal is to finalize negotiations with the selected school for the implementation of the proposed methodology. This will make it possible to schedule the study and begin the process of recruiting student volunteers. If conducting the study at the selected school proves unfeasible, another educational institution will be identified so that the research can proceed, with the tasks outlined in the project roadmap being postponed to a date slightly later than initially planned.

In addition, the authors intend to continue writing the article, dedicating more time to refining the methodology section to ensure that the text becomes complete and cohesive. The lesson plan will also be revised, as the selection of educational software in game format for use in the learning process is still under evaluation. Weekly meetings with the project’s faculty advisor will continue, ensuring consistent updates on the project’s progress and allowing for the reception of guidance and suggestions for the next steps of the research.

## 6. Conclusion and Final Reflections

During the first module of the project, the students were able to significantly deepen their understanding of the topic chosen for the development of their final course project. They acquired new knowledge regarding the execution of research involving experimental procedures, as well as developed skills in academic writing. Initially, the authors outlined the purpose of applying the Game-Based Learning methodology within the context of introductory programming education and presented a methodological proposal to be implemented in the following module. The researchers believe that the study has strong potential to yield meaningful results with regard to advances in education in Brazil — particularly in terms of promoting knowledge about computational thinking.
