## 1. Introduction

Game-Based Learning, as an active learning methodology, is believed to hold significant potential for programming education in basic education institutions in Brazil. To test this hypothesis, the authors intend to conduct a study with high school students who have no prior knowledge of programming yet demonstrate an interest in entering the field. It is anticipated that adopting this methodology could reinforce the acquisition of computational thinking, a skill considered fundamental in today’s context. Investigating the influence of game-based solutions in programming education underscores the importance of adopting innovative strategies within educational institutions. This approach suggests that gamified methods can render the learning process more dynamic and engaging, thereby reducing dropout rates and stimulating student interest from the basic education cycle onward. Furthermore, research into Game-Based Learning aims to expand access to programming education nationwide — challenging the paradigm that the discipline is exclusive to students with superior cognitive abilities or greater resources — and to promote the retention of students enrolled in higher education computing courses, ultimately encouraging the formation of professionals well-equipped for the labor market and fostering the development of innovative methods for conveying complex content.

**General Objective:**

The general objective of this work is to study the influence of pedagogical approaches based on the Game-Based Learning methodology on the learning of computational thinking.

**Specific Objectives:**

- Identify the existing game-based approaches for teaching computational thinking.

- Identify trends regarding the adoption of game-based methodologies in computational thinking education.

- Evaluate the development of computational thinking skills in students using strategies from the Game-Based Learning methodology.

- Collect information from students regarding their experiences with game-based approaches to learning computational thinking

- Assess the benefits and challenges involved in applying game-based methodologies to the teaching of computational thinking.

The specific objectives are directly aligned with the general objective, as they break down the broader goal into concrete investigative steps. By identifying current game-based approaches and trends, the study builds a foundation for understanding the context in which Game-Based Learning is applied. Evaluating student development and gathering their feedback provides insights into how these methodologies impact the learning of computational thinking. Finally, by assessing both benefits and challenges, the work aims to critically analyze the practical implications of implementing Game-Based Learning in this educational context.

## 2. Alignment with Proposed Schedule

- **Was the research process aligned with the initial schedule?**  
  [ ] Yes  
  [X] Partially  
  [ ] No

Our research is structured as an experience report and, as such, required adjustments to the initial planning during the execution of the experiment. During the first module, the authors initiated negotiations with a public high school institution in the city of São Paulo. However, this partnership did not materialize, which resulted in delays in carrying out the activities planned for the second module.

Given the authors’ intention to carry out the experiment by the end of the second module, a detailed timeline was developed and a registration form was made available for workshop participants. However, the number of applicants was insufficient to proceed with the activity, leading to the postponement of the experimental phase to the third module.

Despite the challenges faced, significant progress was made in the development of the methodological framework, the creation of an action plan for the events, and the structuring of a robust teaching plan. The online classroom has already been set up, and the teaching materials have been prepared and properly grounded. Therefore, it is considered that the project is partially aligned with the initially proposed timeline.

## 3. Evolution of the Research

During the first ten weeks of project development, corresponding to the first academic module of the year, the authors made significant progress in the ongoing research. Initially, alignment meetings were held with the faculty advisor overseeing the project, leading to the formulation of a Project Plan that outlined the initial proposal as well as the roadmap for the research development journey. Subsequently, a literature review phase was conducted, during which the authors sought relevant articles and examined the existing body of knowledge related to the topic.

Additionally, the research target audience was defined, establishing the specific elements encompassed by the project. An educational institution was selected, and negotiations were initiated to implement the methodology in partnership with the chosen school.

Regarding the writing of the article, the introduction was developed, including the literature review and outlining the researchers’ objectives with the study. The planned process for the remainder of the year was described, and portions of the methodology section have already been incorporated into the article.

In preparation for the lesson plan to be implemented with the volunteer students, a form was created to recruit participants for the pedagogical experiment. Furthermore, an initial diagnostic questionnaire was developed to assess students’ prior knowledge of computational thinking, as well as a final evaluation form to be administered after the sequence of lessons conducted by the researchers.

Weekly meetings have been held to present the research progress and to define the next steps of the project.

During the second module, the initially planned activities had to be reviewed and reformulated, since they were contingent on a partnership with an institution that did not materialize. During this period, the Introduction and Methodology sections of the article were rewritten to detail the bibliographic survey and article analysis process, as well as to clarify the course design, implementation, and data collection, without linking to any specific institution.

Additionally, a mapping of related high schools was carried out to establish new contacts. The teaching plan was finalized, enhancing the relationship between content and lessons, including activities planned for asynchronous moments. Also in this module, an action plan for the experiment was developed, detailing all steps for its execution, including dissemination strategies, participant selection, and specifications of synchronous and asynchronous models to be adopted.

Infrastructure planning for the event was also conducted: contacts were made with the venue, dates and times were scheduled, and equipment management teams (such as laptops and projectors) were contacted to ensure the event runs smoothly. Although the registration form was released and initial marketing actions were undertaken, due to short notice and low participation, these efforts were suspended. Currently, these actions are being resumed with a new date planned for the experiment.

## 4. Obstacles and Challenges

In the first module, a significant obstacle faced by the authors was obtaining authorization for the proposed experimentation, as it depended on the support of an educational institution that would enable the implementation of the pedagogical workshops. During this period, the researchers were in negotiations with the school considered most suitable for conducting the study. However, there is a possibility that the negotiation may not be successful, which would require seeking another institution for the application of the Game-Based Learning methodology. This limitation currently represents the main concern regarding the progress of the research and may necessitate adjustments to the initially proposed timeline.

In the second module, a new obstacle emerged related to the difficulty in reaching the target audience for registration dissemination, since both authors lack familiarity and established connections with this group. To overcome this barrier, a marketing strategy revision plan was developed, including new approaches for contacting educational institutions that, so far, have shown promising potential to facilitate dissemination and participant recruitment.

## 5. Future Developments

For the third module, the authors aim to effectively carry out the experiment, including the application of a diagnostic assessment, practical classes, activities, and a final exam. Subsequently, they plan to conduct the data collection and processing, as well as initiate descriptive statistics, comparative analysis, and content analysis of the results.

## 6. Conclusion and Final Reflections

During the first module of the project, the students were able to significantly deepen their understanding of the topic chosen for the development of their final course project. They acquired new knowledge related to conducting research involving experimental procedures, as well as developing skills in academic writing. The authors outlined the purpose of applying the Game-Based Learning methodology in the context of teaching computational thinking and presented a methodological proposal to be implemented in the following module.

In the second module, despite the delays faced, the period was extremely rich for the development of the work, mainly due to the theoretical deepening carried out for the application of the methodology. Progress in negotiations and communications established with institutions also provided the students with the development of interpersonal skills, thus going beyond the writing of the article. The researchers remain confident that the study has great potential to generate significant results regarding advances in education in Brazil — especially in promoting knowledge about computational thinking.
